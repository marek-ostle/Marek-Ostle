Travelled for 8 years in my thirties, went around Australia twice then headed for England and acouple part's of Europe but my favourite place is still Cairn's in Quuensland. I have 2 small dogs named Freddie and Jackie and in my spare time i like to make things in the shed. I use to make fire pits sold a couple in an art gallery in Margret River so I was a struggling artist for a short period, I also enjoy a bit of fishing. Oh and I forgot to mention I am married (lol).

Education: Year 10 and Certificate 3 in Metal Fabrication.

Idael Job: My ideal job is to be still working mine's doing something with my IT degree, but when I get further into my degree I will approach HR department what is the best way to go to land a promotion with the compant I am working for.

Online Test Results: From the results of the test I have learned that I should learn to spaek up a bit more when I am in a group meeting. I amy be confident when working in small groups but in larger groups I tend to sit back and let other people make the decisions.
